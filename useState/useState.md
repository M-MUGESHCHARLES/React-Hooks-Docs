## useState

The React `useState` Hook allows us to track state in a function component.

useState accepts an initial state and returns two values:
 - The current state.
 - A function that updates the state.


The useState Hook can be used to keep track of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, etc,.

###### Updating Objects and Arrays in State
When state is updated, the entire state gets overwritten.
We can use the JavaScript spread operator to help us.
